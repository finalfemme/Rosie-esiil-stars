I grew up in California before spending the first 6 years of my adult life in Montana. After completing my Associate of Science degree, I moved to Colorado at the end of 2019. My time among the beautiful Rocky mountains grew into a passion for resource sustainability, eventually leading me to study Environmental Science at MSU Denver. During my studies I realized the incredible potential within biological organisms to assist wtih energy production and remediation efforts, so I added a Biology minor to my academic path. I'm very interested in learning about how biological interactions can impact different parts of the environment so that we might discover how to harness them and improve the world around us. 

##### I hope to learn more about and improve my skills in:

* Quantitative Data Analysis
* Python Coding language
* Asking good research questions

#### I want to know:

* How do environmental remediation projects impact different communities? Are there significant differences in treatment across class, race, religion or geographic categories?
* How are water shortages in the West impacting Indigenous communities?
* How are drought conditions combined with massive water infrastructure influencing the ecosystems along the Colorado River?
